More Practice: Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam
Learning Objective: practice accessing data within an array of objects

You have been tasked with building a list of email addresses of all of our customer's contacts so we can spam them with an email about Miffles the Vampire Weiner Dog.

Create a new project in workspace.
In your JavaScript file, paste the customers array that contains the emails we need to retrieve.
From that array, extract just the customers' contact email addresses and store them in a new array. (Hint: you may want to use forEach() and/or concat() or any other array methods you have learned.)
